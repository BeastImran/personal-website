    <h2 class="section-title">Hello, my name is Shaik Imran!</h2>
    <p>I'm a student interested in every aspect of the software industry and obviously, I am neck-deep into the many sides of software
        technologies. I enjoy building things which addresses, solves and simplifies many things people find as problem or trouble. Moreover, I
        add a personal touch to anything i build to make sure that it is easy to use and gives best User Experience. I have built many personal as
        well as public use projects as shown below which has really made things simpler in life of many people and solved issues of bad
        experience.</p>
