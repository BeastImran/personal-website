    <p>I am a student interested in every aspect of the software industry and very keen to dive deep into software technologies, frameworks and tools of
        my interest. I do things that address, solve and simplify peopleâ€™s lives ðŸ™‚. Moreover, I add a personal touch to anything I build to make
        sure that it is easy to use and gives the best User Experience. I have built many personal as well as public use projects as shown below which
        has really made things simpler in the life of people and solved issues of the bad experience.</p>
